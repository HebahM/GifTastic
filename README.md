# GifTastic
This app uses the giphy API to append gifs of a certain topic to the window.

Some buttons have already been provided, but the user also has the option to add more buttons of their choice.

The buttons provided are various animals. The user can add as many buttons as they wish.

With the click of a button, ten GIFs of that kind of animal will appear on the screen, along with each GIF's title, source, and rating.
Each subsequent button click will replace the GIFs and metadata with new ones.
